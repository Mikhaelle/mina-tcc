  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   During the menstrual cycle people go through various hormonal changes that can lead to
 changes in mood, behavior and physical symptoms. These changes can influence
 positively or negatively the performance of certain daily tasks. To help with self-knowledge, improve emotional intelligence and enable them to use the benefits and deal with
 harm in a healthy and conscious way, this work proposes the realization of an application with a task suggestion system based on
 profile and phase of the menstrual cycle. This system uses recommendation system algorithms, which will suggest tasks
 that require more or less energy to be executed. With bibliographic reference
 it was possible to use the calendar method to determine the phase of the cycle and with the
 case study, it was possible to survey the profiles and daily tasks to be used in the
 recommendation system.
